     <h2>Computer Science in UG</h2>
    <p>This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science.</p> 
    <p>The study of computer science is therefore critical if society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances.</p>
    <p>Computer science involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically. </p>
    <p>At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.</p>
    <p>The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team. </p>
    <p>The course also provides the platform for further study or research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of research in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>

 
    <h2>Our Organization</h2>
    <p>The University of Ghana is one of the Africa's most preeminent public universities.</p>
    <p>Our impact on individuals, our region and the world is profound.</p> 
    <p>Whether we are launching young people into a boundless future or confronting the grand challenges of our time through dauntless research.</p>
    <p>UG educates more than 38,000students annually, with approximately 2.64% being computer science students.</p> 
    <p>We turn ideas into impact and transform the world around us. For more about our impact, visit our news site, UG News.</p>

    <h2>COMPSAA UOG</h2>
    <p> This is the official group for the Computer Science StudentAssociation of University of Ghana</p>
    <p>Its misson and vision is to to promote and protect the positive reputation of Computer Science students and transform them into problem-solvers after school.</p>
    <h4>The main objectives of the association are:</h4>
    <p>a.To promote and facilitate education of students within the Department of Computer 
      Science by:
      i. Developing and promoting academic cooperation among students, such as study 
      groups and peer tutoring.
      ii. Examining and discussing matters of mutual interest related to computer science 
      education and technology.
      iii. Encouraging discussion and action on educational matters that impact students.
      iv. Fostering staff-student interaction through events and activities, such as guest lectures 
      and research collaborations.
      v. Collaborating with other organizations to achieve the above aims, such as other 
      student associations and professional organizations.
     <p>b.To promote and facilitate social interaction among students within the Department of 
      Computer Science by:
      i. Organizing social events and activities that promote community building and 
      networking among students.
      ii. Providing opportunities for students to socialize outside of the classroom environment, 
      such as sports teams or game nights.</p>
