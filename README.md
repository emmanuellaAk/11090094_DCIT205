# Introduction
Welcome to my DCIT 205 Project! This is a 10-page website for the Computer Science Department as a redesigned version or the Markup: [original website](https://dcs.ug.edu.gh/). Each page has been dedicated to a different aspect of the Computer Science Department with additons of a COMPSSA page that is the the Student Association Page and a Resource Page with links to a few materials in relation to the programs studied here. The faculty page has some content which is not available on the original website. This website was created to display a practical application of my web development skills and showcase my comprehension of computer science resources.

The ten pages have been listed below:
1. The Home Page
2. About Page
3. Admissions Page
4. Graduate Page
5. UnderGraduate Page
6. Compssa
7. Short Courses Page
8. Faculty Page
9. Events Page
10. Resource Page


# Cloning And Setting Up The Project
First of all I forked the repository by going to the public repository and created a fork by clciking on "create fork". Then I cloned it to my local repository by using the git command "git clone" with the repository's URL. To ensure that this was succesful, I used the command "git remote -v" and it returned the Url link of the repository.

# What I learnt 
1. Git Proficiency:I learned how to use Git, which helped me copy projects (clone repositories) and start new ones. It's like a toolkit for managing my code.

2. **GitHub Understanding:** I got the hang of GitHub, a place where my code can live and where my team and I can work together smoothly.

3. **Easy HTML and CSS:**  I discovered the simplicity of employing various tags and properties in HTML and CSS, facilitating efficient coding practices.

4. **Form Making Skills:** I got really good at creating functional forms. It's like creating spaces for people to interact with my website.

5. **Links:** I learnt how to create links that would lead me to different pages on the internet or files in the same folder and also how to design such links. eg. turn them into buttons

6. **VSCode Version Control:** I now know how to save and share my code directly from Visual Studio Code, making it simple to keep track of changes.

7. **Flexbox Magic:** I learnt how the flexbox works. It helps in making flexible and responsive designs for my website.

8. **Organized Files:** I acquired the skill of organizing project files into structured folders, optimizing accessibility and ease of navigation for efficient project management..
