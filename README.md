# Introduction #
Welcome to my DCIT 205 Project! This is a 10-page website for the Computer Science Department as a redesigned version or the Markup: [original website](https://dcs.ug.edu.gh/). Each page has been dedicated to a different aspect of the Computer Science Department with additons of a COMPSSA page that is the the Student Association Page and a Resource Page with links to a few materials in relation to the programs studied here. The faculty page has some content which is not available on the original website. This website was created to display a practical application of my web development skills and showcase my comprehension of computer science resources.

The ten pages have been listed below:
1. The Home Page
2. About Page
3. Admissions Page
4. Graduate Page
5. UnderGraduate Page
6. Compssa
7. Short Courses Page
8. Faculty Page

# Cloning And Setting Up The Project
First of all I forked the repository by going to the public repository and created a fork by clciking on "create fork". Then I cloned it to my local repository by using the git command "git clone" with the repository's URL. To ensure that this was succesful, I used the command "git remote -v" and it returned the Url link of the repository.
